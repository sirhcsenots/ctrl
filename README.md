Control Everything

This python package contains code, demos and utilities for
learning to program with the Control Everything series. It also
aides in the process of setup via checking the users system for
dependencies and helping them to resolve them. 

It also provides some simplified wrappers around some common
packages like pygame for educational purposes.
